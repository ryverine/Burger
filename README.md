# Eat-Da-Burger

[Deployed App](https://safe-gorge-84427.herokuapp.com/)

This app allows you to create/name a burger and add that burger to a database.

Created with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. Node and MySQL are used to query and route data, and Handlebars generates the HTML.

This is a Node application that is deployed in Heroku so that it can be accessed via a web browser.

In terms of the visual theme of the app, I was inspired by a 1970's Burger King.
